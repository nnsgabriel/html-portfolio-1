<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>2 Fast 2 Furious</h3>
<p>An ex-cop turned street racer gets caught (in his R34 Skyline) and has to help the FBI catch a criminal to be free of his charges. Great stuff.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Superheroes saving the world doesn't get any better than this.</p>

<h3>Madagascar</h3>
<p>A wonderful, funny animation about animals fleeing from the zoo to find nature. With some cool penguins.</p>
